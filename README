Small, simple, easily auditable tool for changing the rpath
of an ELF executable.

Can only change the rpath if it already exists and the new value is
shorter than the old value.

Usage:

    rpath EXECUTABLE -- print rpath of specified executable
    rpath PATH EXECUTABLE -- set rpath of specified executable

When setting the rpath, the executable is modified in place.
